# buffy demo

Breif:

- Please build this specifically for the 1440 width (doesn't have to be responsive)
- Focus on the interactions with respect to the layers of the page, how each of the individual items animates into the viewport, and layer in a few of your own interactions.
- The menu bar should stay fixed on scroll -- feel free to interpret the interactions on the "Shop" dropdown
- Also, feel free to leverage any and all plugin's or libraries, no restrictions as to how you approach from a technical POV
- The only exception is to avoid the use of jquery
- Limit your effort on this to less than one day (we know you won't finish the implementation, but we want to see how far you might get in a normal workday)
